        "## AOAI Insider Threat Analysis\n",
        "This notebook leverages Azure OpenAI (AOAI) to simulate the reasoning of a cybersecurity analyst. Once users have been nominated as anomalous (e.g., via the train_isolation_forest.ipynb script), this notebook is used to investigate and explain their behavior using log summaries and engineered features.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Approach\n",
        "_Log types: device, email, file, HTTP, logon logs_\n",
        "\n",
        "For a user:\n",
        "1) **Log Retrieval:** Pull logs from each data source for a 60-day window ending at the userâ€™s most recent activity. \n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Log Summarization:** For each log source, the logs are broken into manageable chunks. Azure Open AI analyzes and summarizes each chunk to identify unusual access patterns or suspicious events and assigns relevance scores based on event severity. Azure OpenAI then synthesizes the chunk-level summaries into a single summary per log source, highlighting the most critical behaviors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Final Report Generation:** The synthesized summaries are combined with user background information and engineered features to produce a structured report. The report includes a behavior summary, timeline of anomalous events, risk assessment, and recommended next steps. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Before Running This Notebook\n",
        "- Update \"api_key\" with your Azure OpenAI API Key\n",
        "- Set the \"user\" variable to the username you want to investigate\n",
        "- Set the \"log_window_days\" variable to the desired X number of recent days you would like to analyze. I suggest matching the time range the isolation forest anomaly detection was performed on.\n",
        "- Ensure the cleaned log tables (device, email, file, logon, http) are accessible\n"
